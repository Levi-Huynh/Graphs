'''
Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands.
An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west.

For example:

-nodes:  slands are connected components (in the direction of N, S, W, E only, not diagonal)
-edges: where 1's are connected 
-BFS/DFS- BFS (exposes more connections across the matrix sooner/shorter path)
-directed/undirected- undirected (can go either direction with 1's in the connection)
-cyclic/acyclic : undirected, normally cyclic  4 1's example is possible

-Tuples can be hashed/ used as key for dicts (its immutable)

islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],   
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

print(island_counter(islands)) # returns 4

LEVI'S
islands[range 5][range 5]

if island[i][j] =has 1 neighbor in matrix:=> BEFORE, island[i+1][j], [i+1][j+1] , [i+1][j-1],  AFTER, [i-1][j]  [i-1][j+1], [i-1][j-1]
create check to make sure in bounds 
island count+=1 

have starting vertext
iterate thru vertext to see if has neighbor 1 using helper function (with ^ given slots)
have helper function return all neighbors in N/W/E/S in a list
island count+=1 for length of neighgbor list returned from helper 
append neighbors to path copy that has starting vertex & all neighbors
plug into stack/que : i think stack (iterate from one row, depth wise, & explre all directions)
pop STACK wont unstack until take care of children DFS/deque BFS  
add to visited if not in visited
loop to return total island count (number of neighbors each vert in 2d array has)

other ideas:
-change 1 to 0 , check if there another 1 near now changed 0, repeat until theres no
one (how to check for 1 near zero?)
